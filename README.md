1. Object pooling was implemented in the TAâ€™s starter code by having the enemies in an
object pool where once the last remaining enemy is killed, the one that was killed first
(which returned to the pool) re-spawns. This makes it so that there are constant waves
of enemies that spawn without creating new objects each time, but rather re-using the
same two enemies that are in the object pool. This optimizes the scene because creating
and destroying new enemies each time the player gets a kill would significantly slow
down the game over time. With the implementation of object pooling, it becomes much
more efficient.
